The previous real-time chat is not a full-stack-app. So I decided to improve on that with a database and backend server.

Here's why I build this app:
* Socket.io doesn't save all messages, so every time the app restarts, all messages are gone.
* There's a cool library called Pusher that enables real-time stream exchange between front-end and back-end.
* The previous version doesn't have a sign up function, so every time user joins the chat, he or she has to retype the username

Now, this cool app allows a real-time fetching of messages from MongoDB to React without any speed concern! It also allows a google login feature and the user can have their google username and avatar in the chat room.
